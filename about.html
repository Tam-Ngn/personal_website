        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in the south of Vietnam, in a province called <strong>Tây Ninh</strong> that borders Cambodia. As it’s less well-known internationally, I often simplify it by saying I’m from <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong>.</p>

    <h2>One fun fact about me</h2>
    <p>My favorite number is <strong>21</strong> because I was born on January 1, 2001—written as <code>010101</code> in short, which happens to be the binary representation of 21!</p>

        <h2>My Educational Background</h2>
        <p>I left Vietnam after finishing grade 11 to pursue an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma. I was fortunate to be one of the 12 students selected to join the UWC (United World Colleges) network and attend a UWC school in Suzhou, China. Following that incredible experience, I moved to the United States for college at Macalester College, where I earned a double degree in Computer Science and Statistics.</p>

        <h2>What I'm Interested In</h2>
        <p>I originally came to the United States intending to pursue a career in Economics. However, thanks to Macalester College being a liberal arts college, I had the opportunity to explore a wide range of disciplines. Before I even realized it, I was already on track to complete a Statistics degree by the spring of my sophomore year.</p>
        <p>Given the emerging importance of data and AI at the time, I decided to also pursue a second degree in Computer Science. I saw it as a way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and enhance my ability to analyze data effectively and write optimized code. That decision ultimately shaped my path into the field of machine learning and data engineering.</p>
